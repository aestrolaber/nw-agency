# Voice AI Market Research Brief
**For: Perplexity Deep Research**
**Context: nw. Agency — AI Voice & Chat Sales System**

---

## Who We Are & What We've Built

We are **nw. agency**, a Moroccan AI agency that installs AI voice and chat agents for businesses. Our system works as follows:

- An **AI voice agent** answers inbound phone calls 24/7 in French (and English), captures leads, answers FAQs, and books appointments — even at 2am.
- An **AI chat widget** is embedded on the business's website and does the same via text.
- We build a **personalized live demo** for each prospect showing their own business with the AI already installed — they can call it and chat with it before signing anything.
- We charge a **monthly retainer** (1 500 to 3 500 MAD/month in Morocco, $497–$1 997/month internationally).

**Current status:** Platform is built and live. We are identifying our first real paying clients.

---

## The Core Problem We Solve

Most small-to-medium businesses in Morocco (and internationally) lose between **30–60% of inbound leads** because:

1. Calls come in after hours and nobody picks up
2. Website visitors have questions but there is no chat — they leave
3. The owner or secretary is busy and can't answer every call
4. Potential customers go to the competitor who answers first

Our AI agent captures 100% of these contacts, 24/7, and either books them directly or passes the lead to the human team during business hours.

## Why Some Businesses Are NOT Good Targets (Critical Context)

We learned this the hard way with our first prospect (a legal tech SaaS company). The wrong targets are:

- **Tech companies / startups** — they can build this themselves using HighLevel, Voiceflow, or custom APIs
- **Large corporations** — procurement takes months, no single decision maker
- **Darija-only businesses** — our voice agent currently speaks French (and English). Businesses whose customers only speak Darija (Moroccan Arabic dialect) are excluded for now
- **Very low deal-value businesses** — if a missed call is worth 50 MAD, the ROI doesn't justify 1 500 MAD/month
- **Businesses without inbound call/lead volume** — no volume = nothing for the AI to capture

---

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

A perfect prospect scores high on ALL of the following:

### 1. High Tech Barrier
The business owner or manager **cannot** and would **not** build an AI system themselves. They are a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer, a real estate agent — not a developer. They have no IT team. They use WhatsApp and Google Docs and that's about it.

### 2. French-Fluent Clientele (Morocco context)
Because our voice agent speaks French, the business's **customers** must be French speakers. In Morocco, this naturally filters toward:
- Upper-middle class and above
- Urban (Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakech, Tanger, Fès)
- Educated professionals and their families
- Expats and Moroccan diaspora

### 3. High Inbound Volume with High Cost Per Missed Lead
The business receives many calls and messages. Each missed contact has a real financial cost. The ROI math must be obvious:
- If a missed patient is worth 5 000 MAD and they recover just 1 per month → the agent pays for itself 3x over
- Ideally: deal value ≥ 3 000 MAD OR very high volume (50+ contacts/week)

### 4. Owner Is the Decision Maker
No committee. No board. No IT approval. The person who benefits from the AI is the same person who can say "yes" on a Tuesday morning. This is typically a business owner, a doctor running their private practice, an agency director.

### 5. Appointment-Based or Lead-Based Business Model
The AI's strongest use case is: **capture the contact, answer the FAQ, book the appointment, pass the lead**. This works best for businesses that:
- Sell appointments (medical, legal, cosmetic, automotive)
- Sell high-value services where a conversation leads to a sale
- Have a defined "next step" (book a consultation, request a quote, schedule a visit)

### 6. Existing Pain (They're Already Feeling It)
They already know they're missing calls. They've said to themselves: *"I need a secretary,"* or *"I need someone to answer the phone at night."* They just don't know AI can do it for 1/10th the cost.
