# Selling AI Agents to US & High-GDP Markets
> Strategy guide for expanding nw. Agency beyond Morocco.

## Why This Makes Sense

You're already building the infrastructure. The marginal cost of serving a US client vs a Moroccan one is near zero — you just:
- Write prompts in English
- Price in USD
- Run cold outreach in English

The revenue difference is dramatic:

| Market | Monthly retainer | Your cost | Gross margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Morocco (MAD) | 1,500 MAD (~$150) | ~$20 | ~87% |
| USA (USD) | $800–2,000 | ~$20 | ~99% |
| UK/EU (EUR) | €600–1,500 | ~$20 | ~99% |

> **The product is identical. The price is 8-12x higher.**

## Best Niches for AI Voice + Chat Agents (US Market)

Target businesses that:
1. Receive inbound calls/inquiries constantly
2. Miss leads after hours
3. Have high client lifetime value (makes your ROI pitch easy)
4. Are local/regional (no big-corp legal barrier)

### Tier 1 — Highest ROI, easiest pitch

| Niche | Why they buy | Monthly price range |
|---|---|---|
| **Law firms** (personal injury, immigration, family law) | Missed call = $5,000+ case gone to competitor | $1,000–3,000/mo |
| **Real estate agents/teams** | Leads at 10pm, weekends | $800–2,000/mo |
| **Dental/medical offices** | Booking calls, after-hours, no-shows | $600–1,500/mo |
| **Insurance agencies** | Quote requests at all hours | $800–2,000/mo |
| **Mortgage brokers** | Leads move fast — speed is everything | $800–2,000/mo |

### Tier 2 — High volume, slightly lower price

| Niche | Why they buy | Monthly price range |
|---|---|---|
| Home services (HVAC, plumbing, roofing) | Emergency calls, weekend jobs | $500–1,200/mo |
| Car dealerships | After-hours inventory questions | $700–1,500/mo |
| Financial advisors | Qualifying prospects before a call | $600–1,500/mo |
| Plastic surgery / aesthetics clinics | High-value discreet inquiries | $1,000–2,500/mo |
| Tutoring / education centers | Parent inquiries 7pm-11pm | $400–900/mo |

## Pricing Strategy (USD)

### Packages

| Package | What's included | Price |
|---|---|---|
| **Starter** | Chat agent, English only, basic lead capture | $497/mo |
| **Growth** | Chat + voice agent, multilingual, Calendly booking, monthly report | $997/mo |
| **Scale** | All of Growth + CRM integration, custom knowledge base, 2 agent updates/mo | $1,997/mo |
| **Setup fee** | One-time configuration | $500–1,500 |

### Pilot offer (same strategy as Morocco)
- Month 1: **Free** — remove all friction
- Month 2+: $997/mo
- Framing: *"If the AI gets you one extra client this month, it's already paid for itself 3x."*

### Anchor with ROI (law firm example)
```
Average case value:     $5,000 (personal injury)
Leads captured per mo:  +3 (conservative AI estimate)
Revenue added:          +$15,000/mo
Your fee:               $997/mo
ROI:                    1,400%
```

## Cold Outreach — US Market

### Channels (in order of effectiveness)

1. **Cold email** — still works in the US, especially with personalization
2. **LinkedIn** (Sales Navigator for targeting) — great for professionals
3. **Cold calling** — less common from abroad, but possible
4. **Instagram/Facebook DM** — for local businesses with active social

### Cold Email Framework (US)

**Subject:** I built something for [Business Name]

```
Hi [First Name],

I came across [Business Name] while researching [niche] in [City].

Quick question: what happens when someone calls your office at 9pm on a Saturday?

I built a 60-second demo showing what your business would look like with an AI agent that answers calls and chat 24/7, qualifies leads, and books appointments automatically.

No forms. No pitch. Just [DEMO LINK].

Worth a look?

[Your Name]
nw. Agency — AI Sales Infrastructure
```

**Why this works:**
- Calls out the specific pain (missed after-hours calls)
- Demo link does the selling for you (your Digital Donut)
- No ask, no pressure
- Personalized to their niche

### LinkedIn DM (500 characters)

```
Hi [Name], came across [Business Name] — [personal observation].

Built a quick AI demo for your type of business: it answers calls, chats with leads, and books appointments 24/7.

Takes 30 seconds to try: [DEMO LINK]

No pitch — just a demo. Curious what you think.
```

## Legal Considerations — Selling from Morocco to US

### Can you legally sell to US clients as a Moroccan AE?

**Yes.** Selling services to foreign clients is treated as **export of services** in Morocco. It is:
- Fully legal
- Exempt from Moroccan VAT (on export)
- Subject to Office des Changes declaration (automatic when money enters via bank)

### US side — do you need to be a US company?
**No — for most small businesses, your Moroccan status is fine.**

However, a **US LLC** unlocks:
- Stripe (online card payments — US clients expect this)
- US business bank account (Mercury, Relay)
- Higher perceived credibility
- Better contract enforceability in US courts

→ See [US_LLC_SETUP.md](./US_LLC_SETUP.md) for full setup guide.

### Data & Privacy
US clients handling consumer data may ask about:
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act) — add a privacy policy to your demo pages
- **GDPR** (if EU clients) — you'll need a data processing agreement

Minimal steps:
1. Add a simple Privacy Policy page to your site
2. Mention in your contract that client data is processed via OpenAI/VAPI (third parties with their own compliance)
3. Don't store conversation transcripts unless the client needs it

## Revenue Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Morocco (now)
- 1–3 clients at 1,500–2,200 MAD/month
- Focus on Legal Plus + 2 more local pilots
- Learn the delivery process, refine the product

### Phase 2 — International pilots (Month 2–4)
- Run 20-30 cold emails/day targeting US niches
- Goal: 1–2 paying US clients at $497–997/month
- Use existing demo infrastructure (new prospect = new entry in prospects.ts)

### Phase 3 — Scale (Month 4+)
- Form US LLC → enable Stripe → offer card-on-file subscriptions
- 5–10 US/EU clients at $997/month = $5,000–10,000 MRR
- Start hiring a VA for outreach

### The math at 10 clients ($997/mo avg)
```
Revenue:         $9,970/month
VAPI + OpenAI:   ~$200/month (across all clients)
LLC + tools:     ~$300/month
Net profit:      ~$9,470/month (~94,000 MAD)
```

| UK | English | Bank transfer, card | Strong SME market, GDPR-adjacent |
| Canada | EN/FR | Card, Interac | Quebec = French market opportunity |

> **Start with USA + UK** — same language, high prices, volume of SMEs.
