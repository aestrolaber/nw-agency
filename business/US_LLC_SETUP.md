# Forming a US LLC as a Non-Resident (from Morocco)
> The key that unlocks Stripe, US banking, and US client credibility.

---

## Should You Do This?

**Not immediately — but plan for it by Month 2–3.**

Do it when:
- You have 1+ paying international clients lined up
- You want to accept card payments (Stripe)
- A client asks "are you a registered business?"
- You're ready to invest ~$300–500 one-time

**Skip for now if:**
- You're still in the Moroccan pilot phase
- Clients are paying by bank transfer and don't care
- You have zero international clients yet

## Why Wyoming or Delaware?

### Wyoming LLC (recommended for solo operators)
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| State fee | $100/year |
| No state income tax | You won't pay Wyoming state tax as a non-resident |
| Privacy | No public disclosure of members (owners) |
| No registered agent visits needed | Done by mail/online |
| Formation time | 1–3 business days |
| Formation cost (DIY) | $100 state fee only |
| Formation cost (service) | $200–400 total (service fee + state fee) |

### Delaware LLC (alternative)
- More prestigious (investors, VCs know it)
- Slightly more complex, ~$300/year total
- Better if you ever want investors or to raise money
- **Not needed for a solo service business**

> **Choose Wyoming** unless you're planning to raise investment.

---

## Formation Options

### Option A — DIY (cheapest, ~$100)
1. Go to Wyoming Secretary of State website
2. File Articles of Organization online
3. Pay $100 state fee
4. You become your own registered agent (needs a US address)

**Problem:** You need a US address for the registered agent. If you don't have one, use Option B.

---

### Option B — Formation Service (recommended, ~$200–400 total)

These services handle everything and provide a US registered agent address:

| Service | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Doola** | $297 one-time + $100/yr state | Best for non-residents, includes EIN, operating agreement |
| **Northwest Registered Agent** | $39 formation + $125/yr agent | Very solid, privacy-focused |
| **Stripe Atlas** | $500 one-time | Includes Stripe account setup — worth it if that's your goal |
| **Firstbase.io** | $399 one-time | Good for international founders |
| **Incfile** | $0 + state fee + agent | Budget option, basic service |

> **Recommended path:** Doola or Northwest Registered Agent.
> **If Stripe is the priority:** Stripe Atlas (slightly more expensive but seamless).

---

## What You Get After Formation

1. **LLC name** — e.g., "NW Agency LLC" or "NW Digital LLC"
2. **Certificate of Formation** (official document)
3. **Operating Agreement** (internal doc — keep it)
4. **Registered Agent address** (US mailing address for legal docs)

---

## Step 2 — Get an EIN (Employer Identification Number)

The EIN is your LLC's US tax ID. You need it for:
- Opening a US bank account
- Stripe
- Invoicing US clients (some require it)

### How to get an EIN as a non-resident
- **Via IRS Form SS-4** — fax or mail to the IRS (takes 4–6 weeks)
- **Via phone** — call IRS international line +1-267-941-1099 (fastest, same day)
- **Via your formation service** — most include EIN for $50–75 extra

> Call the IRS directly — it's free, takes ~30 minutes, and you get the EIN immediately.

**IRS International Line:** +1-267-941-1099
Mon–Fri, 6am–11pm Eastern time
Have ready: LLC name, formation state (Wyoming), your CIN number, your address, business activity description

---

## Step 3 — Open a US Business Bank Account

As a non-resident with a Wyoming LLC + EIN, you can open accounts at:

| Bank | Monthly fee | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Mercury** | $0 | Best for startups and online businesses. Apply 100% online. Widely recommended for non-residents. |
| **Relay** | $0 | Similar to Mercury, good multi-account features |
| **Wise Business** | $0 | International focus, multi-currency — pairs well with Wise personal |
| **Brex** | $0 | Requires some revenue, better for growth stage |

> **Start with Mercury** — opens online in 1–3 days, no branch visits, works globally.

**Mercury signup:** [mercury.com](https://mercury.com)
Requirements: LLC docs (Certificate of Formation), EIN, your passport/CIN

---

## Step 4 — Set Up Stripe

Once you have:
- Wyoming LLC
- EIN
- Mercury bank account (US routing + account numbers)

You can create a **Stripe** account:

1. Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Sign up as a business
3. Business type: LLC
4. Country: **United States**
5. Enter EIN, LLC name, Mercury bank details
6. Stripe reviews in 24–48h
7. **You can now charge US clients by credit card**

### Stripe fees
- 2.9% + $0.30 per successful card charge
- No monthly fee
- Payouts to Mercury (then wire to Morocco via Wise)

### What you can sell via Stripe
- Monthly subscriptions (set up recurring billing)
- One-time setup fees
- Upgrade/downgrade plans

---

## Step 5 — Repatriate Money to Morocco

Flow:
```
Client pays Stripe
    ↓
Stripe → Mercury (USD)
    ↓
Mercury → Wise (international transfer, low fee)
    ↓
Wise → Your Moroccan bank account (MAD or USD)
```

**Key rule:** When money arrives in Morocco, your bank will report it to the **Office des Changes**. This is automatic. You don't need to do anything extra — just keep your invoices and contracts as proof of service.

## Tax Obligations as a Non-Resident LLC Owner

### US federal taxes
A single-member LLC owned by a foreign national is a **disregarded entity** by default.
- If you have **no US-source income** (all clients are outside the US), you likely owe **$0 US federal income tax**
- You may still need to file **Form 5472** annually (informational return for foreign-owned US entities)
- **File Form 5472 by the due date** — the penalty for missing it is $25,000. Use a US accountant or service like Doola/Stripe Atlas for this.

### Morocco taxes
- Your LLC income is income to you personally
- Declare it as professional income in your AE quarterly declaration
- 2% of revenue collected applies

### Annual maintenance costs
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Wyoming state fee | $100/year |
| Registered agent | $125/year (if using a service) |
| Form 5472 filing | $150–300/year (accountant) |
| **Total annual overhead** | **~$375–525/year** |

---

## Timeline

| Week | Action |

## Cost Summary
